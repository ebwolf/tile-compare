A Tile-Based Method of Estimating Quality of Volunteered Geographic Information

Various methods have been employed to estimate the quality of volunteered 
geographic information. These methods depend on establishing semantic link
 between features in a database of known quality and the VGI-sourced database.
Vector geospatial operations (buffer, clip, length) are then employed to 
calculate error at the feature level. This paper presents a method of 
estimating quality through image analysis of raster tiles created from a 
database of known quality versus a VGI-sourced database.

The tile-based method has several distinct advantages. First, it does not
require a semantic link between features in the databases. Second, the 
method simultaneously provides estimates of positional accuracy and 
completeness. Third, it is embedded in the tile-oriented cartography
employed by modern digital maps.
